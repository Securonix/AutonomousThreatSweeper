After initial exploitation, the attackers deployed a custom loader and PowerShell scripts to pivot across more than ten internal Windows servers, escalating privileges and disabling security controls. WarLock simultaneously exfiltrated sensitive corporate data, including salary tables and network diagrams, before encrypting approximately 30 TB of file shares with its proprietary ransomware payload. The campaign demonstrates the actor’s continued focus on unpatched Microsoft Office stack components and its capability to blend living-off-the-land binaries with DLL injection to evade EDR and SIEM detection.

SharePoint_Exploit_Enables_Enterprise_Wide_Ransomware,Trend Micro,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/h/warlock-ransomware.html,"Trend Micro reports that the Warlock ransomware group is exploiting unpatched on-premise Microsoft SharePoint servers to gain initial footholds, escalate privileges through malicious Group Policy Objects, and deploy a LockBit-derived payload across victim networks. Once inside, Warlock disables security tooling with a bespoke KillAV driver, performs credential dumping with Mimikatz, and propagates laterally via SMB and RDP configuration changes. Reconnaissance and domain-trust discovery are conducted using built-in Windows utilities before data is exfiltrated with a renamed RClone binary and files are encrypted with the .x2anylock extension. Victims span government, technology, finance, manufacturing, and critical-infrastructure sectors across North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, underscoring broad operational scope. The campaign demonstrates rapid weaponisation of public-facing application flaws and highlights the business impact of delayed patching, ineffective privilege hygiene, and insufficient defense-in-depth.",HIGH,2025-08-23,Yes
SendGrid_Campaign,Cofense,https://cofense.com/blog/phishing-in-the-cloud-sendgrid-campaign-exploits-account-security,"Cofense researchers have identified a phishing campaign that abuses SendGrid’s email services to steal user credentials. The attackers distribute phishing emails through SendGrid’s platform to evade security filters. The campaign leverages three main lures such as New Login Location Alert, Elite Tier Promotion, Phone Number Changed Alert. All three emails use spoofed sender addresses, polished formatting, and official-looking logos to appear legitimate. Additionally, the attackers exploit an open redirect vulnerability to make their malicious links as legitimate. Victims who click these links are redirected to a phishing site (loginportalsg[.]com) that closely mimic SendGrid’s official login page, tricking victims into disclosing their credentials.",LOW,2025-08-22,Yes

APT36_Linux_Phishing_Targets_Indian_Defence,cloudsek,https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery,"Researchers at CloudSEK have observed Pakistan-linked APT36 (aka Transparent Tribe) weaponising Linux .desktop shortcut files to spear-phish Indian defence and government personnel. The attackers email ZIP archives containing shortcuts disguised as procurement documents. When a victim clicks, the shortcut downloads a Go-based payload from Google Drive, writes it to /tmp, executes it, and displays a decoy PDF to reduce suspicion. The payload installs GNOME autostart entries and performs anti-analysis checks to evade sandboxes. It then initiates a WebSocket channel to external command-and-control infrastructure, enabling interactive commands and silent file exfiltration. These behaviours confirm an espionage objective focused on sensitive procurement and operational data, not destruction or extortion. The campaign demonstrates APT36’s expanding Linux capability, effective cloud-hosted delivery, and icon spoofing for user deception. Successful compromise grants persistent, covert access to India’s strategic defence ecosystem, posing significant national-security risk.",MEDIUM,2025-08-21,Yes

Blue Locker leverages a PowerShell-based loader to disable security controls, escalate privileges, and deploy its ransomware payload. Persistence is maintained through Registry Run keys, while shadow copies are deleted to hinder recovery efforts. Once executed, the malware appends the [.]Blue extension to encrypted files, selectively targets specific file types, and uses a combination of AES and RSA encryption to secure victim data. Ransom notes are dropped instructing victims to negotiate payment through email or instant messaging channels rather than a public leak site. Pakistan’s National CERT has attributed Blue Locker to the Shinra malware family, noting similarities with Conti and Black Basta.",MEDIUM,2025-08-18,Yes

SonicWall_SMA_Exploitation_via_OVERSTEP,Google Threat Intelligence,https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sonicwall-secure-mobile-access-exploitation-overstep-backdoor,"Google Threat Intelligence Group have observed financially motivated activity by the threat actor UNC6148 targeting end-of-life SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances. These campaigns exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched or outdated devices to gain initial access. UNC6148 leveraged these vulnerabilities to obtain administrator credentials and one-time password (OTP) seed values—effectively bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA). Once inside, they deployed OVERSTEP, a previously undocumented user-mode rootkit and backdoor. OVERSTEP achieves persistence through multiple techniques: injecting a malicious shared object via /etc/ld.so.preload and modifying the system’s INITRD image, allowing the malware to survive reboots. The rootkit covertly hijacks file API functions to hide its presence, establishes reverse shells using bash, and exfiltrates sensitive data—including SQLite databases and certificate files—through web-accessible directories. The primary targets are organizations with externally exposed SMA appliances running outdated firmware. The compromise facilitates credential theft, undermines authentication mechanisms, enables extortion, and may lay the groundwork for future ransomware attacks.",HIGH,2025-07-18,Yes
