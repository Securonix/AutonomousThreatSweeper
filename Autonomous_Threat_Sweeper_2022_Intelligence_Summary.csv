Latrodectus_Malware,Cryptolaemus Group,https://github.com/pr0xylife/Latrodectus/blob/main/Latrodectus_29.04.2024.txt,"Latrodectus malware, also known as Unidentified 111 and IceNova, is now being employed in phishing campaigns that exploit Microsoft Azure and Cloudflare themes to bypass email security systems. Initially identified by Walmart's security team and later analyzed by ProofPoint and Team Cymru, this Windows malware downloader functions as a backdoor to download additional payloads or execute commands. Although it is unclear whether Latrodectus will replace the IcedID malware loader, its usage in phishing and contact form spam is on the rise, aimed at infiltrating corporate networks. These phishing attempts often start with reply-chain emails containing malicious PDFs or URLs that mimic legitimate Azure-hosted documents, leading to a deceptive Cloudflare captcha designed to thwart automated security scans and ensure payloads are delivered only to actual users. Upon solving this captcha, a JavaScript file—disguised as a document—downloads an MSI file, which installs a DLL via rundll32.exe into the user’s system, enabling Latrodectus to execute quietly in the background.
